kernel space	The reserved memory area where the Linux kernel operates.
user space	The area of memory where user applications run.
Monolithic kernel	A kernel where all services and drivers are part of the kernel; fast but less secure.
Micro kernel	A kernel that runs drivers in user space; slower but more stable and secure.
uname	Prints system information like kernel version and architecture.
Kernel Layers	The structure includes: System Call Interface, Process Manager, Memory Manager, File System Manager, VFS, Device Management.
System Call Interface (SCI)	Interface that allows user space apps to request services from the kernel.
Process Management	Handles creation, scheduling, and termination of processes.
Memory Management	Manages RAM and swap; allocates memory to processes.
File System Manager	Manages access and storage of files on disk.
Virtual File System (VFS)	Abstract layer between user applications and actual file systems.
Device Management	Manages device input/output and communication with hardware.
/usr/lib/modules/	Directory containing kernel modules (add-ons for the kernel).
lsmod	Displays currently loaded kernel modules.
modinfo	Displays information about a specific kernel module.
insmod	Manually inserts a kernel module.
rmmod	Removes a kernel module from the running kernel.
modprobe	Loads or unloads kernel modules intelligently based on dependencies.
depmod	Regenerates the module dependency database.
blacklist	Blocks specific kernel modules from being auto-loaded.
install	Used in modprobe configs to define behavior of specific module installations.
/proc/sys/	Virtual directory containing kernel runtime parameters.
sysctl	Tool to view and modify kernel runtime parameters.
/etc/sysctl.conf	Main configuration file for persistent kernel parameter changes.
/proc/	Virtual filesystem that provides information about kernel processes.
dmesg	Displays kernel messages, especially driver and hardware-related logs.
