OSI model	The seven-layer framework describing network functions from physical to application.
Physical layer	Handles transmission of raw bits over a physical medium.
Data link layer	Provides node-to-node data transfer and error detection (MAC addresses).
Network layer	Manages packet routing and forwarding (IP addresses).
Transport layer	Ensures end-to-end communication reliability (TCP/UDP).
Session layer	Controls dialogues between applications.
Presentation layer	Translates data formats and encryption.
Application layer	Provides network services to end-user applications.
TCP/IP suite	A simplified four-layer model for network communication.
Node	A device on the network with a unique address.
MAC address	A hardware identifier for a network interface.
IP address	A logical identifier assigned to a device on a network.
Hostname	A human-readable name mapped to an IP address.
Router	A device that forwards packets between networks.
Packet	A unit of data at the network layer.
Frame	A packet encapsulated with a header/trailer at the data link layer.
Bit	A single binary digit transmitted at the physical layer.
DNS	Domain Name System; translates hostnames to IP addresses.
DHCP	Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol; assigns IP configuration to clients.
Reserved IP ranges	Private network address blocks (e.g., 10.0.0.0/8, 192.168.0.0/16).
Loopback address	The IP address (127.0.0.1) used by a host to send traffic to itself.

SSH server	A host that accepts secure shell connections.
SMTP server	A host responsible for sending email.
HTTP server	A host that serves web content over the web’s standard protocol.
POP3 server	A host that provides email retrieval service.
HTTPS server	A host that serves web content over a secure protocol.
Certificate Authority	A trusted entity that issues digital certificates.
SNMP server	A host that gathers and reports network management data.
LDAP server	A host that provides directory-based authentication.
Proxy server	A middleman for client requests to improve performance or filter content.
Syslog server	A host that collects and stores system log messages from multiple sources.
Load balancer	Distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers for scalability.
File/print server	A host providing shared file storage or printing services.
Samba service	Enables Windows-compatible file and printer sharing.
NFS server	A host providing native Linux/Unix file sharing.
VPN server	A host enabling secure remote network connections.
Hostname configuration	Setting the system’s network identity name.
Network Identity	The combination of IP address, hostname, and MAC address necessary for connectivity.
NIC (Network Interface Card)	The hardware interface for network communications.
nmcli	Command-line tool for managing network connections.
nmtui	Text-based interface for network configuration.
ifconfig	Legacy tool for displaying and configuring network interfaces.
ip tool	Modern utility for network interface and routing configuration.
iwconfig	Tool for configuring wireless network interfaces.
DHCP DORA process	The sequence of Discover, Offer, Request, Acknowledge in DHCP.
Hosts file	A local file (/etc/hosts) mapping hostnames to IP addresses.
Resolver configuration	The file (/etc/resolv.conf) listing DNS servers for hostname resolution.
Name service switch	File (/etc/nsswitch.conf) determining order of name resolution sources.
dig	A utility to query DNS servers directly for records.
nslookup	Interactive tool for querying DNS.
host	A simple utility to perform DNS lookups.
whois	Tool to query domain registration information.
SaaS (Software as a Service)	Cloud model providing software applications over the internet.
PaaS (Platform as a Service)	Cloud model providing platforms for application development.
IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)	Cloud model providing virtualized computing resources.
Public cloud	Shared cloud infrastructure available to multiple organizations.
Private cloud	Cloud infrastructure dedicated to a single organization.
Hybrid cloud	A combination of public and private cloud models.
Virtualization	The creation of virtual instances of hardware resources.
Hypervisor	Type 1 runs on bare metal; Type 2 runs on a host OS.

Wireshark	A packet analyzer for network traffic inspection.
ping	A tool to test reachability of network devices.
netstat	Reports network connections and statistics.
ss	A modern utility for listing socket information.
traceroute	Shows the path packets take to a destination.
nmap	Scans for open ports and services on network hosts.
tcpdump	Captures and displays network packet headers.
netcat	A versatile networking tool for reading/writing data across networks.
iftop	Displays bandwidth usage per connection in real time.
iperf	Measures maximum network throughput between hosts.
mtr	Combines ping and traceroute for network diagnostics.
arp	Displays and manipulates the system ARP table.
routing loop	A network condition where packets circulate repeatedly between routers.
