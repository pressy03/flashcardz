Partition (part)	A division of a storage device for organizing data separately.
Block devices	Storage devices (e.g., HDDs, SSDs) that transfer data in fixed-size blocks.
Character devices	Devices like keyboards and mice that transmit data one character at a time.
FAT	File system compatible with most OSs; used in older or portable devices.
ext2	Old Linux file system, no journaling.
ext3	Ext2 with journaling; better data integrity.
ext4	Improved ext3, supports large volumes and files.
XFS	64-bit journaling file system, fast crash recovery.
BTRFS	Advanced file system; supports snapshots, error detection, and scaling.
SMB	Protocol for sharing files over a network, mainly Windows.
CIFS	Common Internet File System — version of SMB.
NFS	Network File System, Linux-native protocol for file sharing.
Inode	A data structure storing metadata about files.
VFS (Virtual File System)	Layer between kernel and real file system — translates system calls.
Drive labels	Identifiers for partitions; max 16 characters.
e2label / xfs_admin	Tools for viewing/modifying labels on ext/XFS file systems.
Primary partition	Used for booting or swap; can contain OS.
Extended partition	Contains multiple logical drives; not directly mountable.
Logical partition	Created inside extended partition; used for organizing storage.
fdisk	Creates and manages disk partitions.
fdisk commands	p: print, n: new partition, d: delete, w: write changes.
parted	Partition manager for modern disks; supports larger disks and GPT.
partprobe	Updates the kernel after partition changes.
mkfs	Creates a new file system on a partition.
fstab	File that configures which partitions mount and how at boot.
fstab columns	Device, mount point, file system type, mount options, dump, fsck order.
/etc/crypttab	Config file for encrypted partitions to unlock at boot.
/dev	Directory where device files (like /dev/sda1) are located.
/dev/null	Discards all data written to it — "black hole" file.
/dev/zero	Outputs infinite null bytes — used to wipe disks.
/dev/urandom	Outputs random bytes — used for generating secure data.
Device mapper	Virtual layer for managing logical storage on physical disks.
dm-multipath	Redundant storage links for fault tolerance.
/etc/multipath.conf	Config file for multipath settings.
mdadm	Command-line RAID manager.
RAID 5	Striping + parity; needs 3 disks; survives 1 failure.
RAID 6	Like RAID 5 but with dual parity; survives 2 failures.
RAID 10	Combines striping and mirroring; needs 4 disks minimum.
/proc/mdstat	Kernel file showing current RAID status.
LVM (Logical Volume Manager)	Creates/manage logical volumes from physical storage.
pv* commands	Manage physical volumes (pvcreate, pvscan, pvremove, etc.).
vg* commands	Manage volume groups (vgcreate, vgs, vgextend, vgremove, etc.).
lv* commands	Manage logical volumes (lvcreate, lvs, lvextend, lvremove, etc.).
mount	Attaches a file system to a mount point.
mount options	auto, noauto, nouser, user, exec, noexec, ro, rw, sync, async.
umount	Unmounts a file system.
umount options	-f: force, -l: lazy, -R: recursive, -t: unmount specific types, -O: unmount with option.
systemd.mount	File-based mount using systemd instead of fstab.
FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace)	Allows mounting unusual or remote file systems via user space.
mtab vs /proc/mounts	`/etc/mtab` is legacy; `/proc/mounts` is the accurate source of mount info.
/proc/partitions	Shows major/minor numbers, blocks, and partition names.
lsblk	List block devices.
blkid	Display or print UUIDs and labels of block devices.
fsck	File system consistency checker.
e2fsck	Check/repair ext2/ext3/ext4 file systems.
resize2fs	Resize ext file systems.
tune2fs	Adjust ext file system parameters (journaling, mount count, etc.).
dumpe2fs	Dump detailed info from ext superblocks.
xfs_info	Show info about XFS file systems.
xfs_admin	Modify XFS labels and UUIDs.
xfs_metadump	Copy XFS metadata for analysis.
xfs_growfs	Expand an XFS file system.
xfs_copy	Copy XFS file systems.
xfs_repair	Check and fix XFS file system errors.
xfs_db	Debug tool for XFS file systems.
lsscsi	Show connected SCSI devices.
fcstat	Show statistics about optical drives.
ulimit	Set limits on system resources like open files.
df	Show available disk space.
du	Show disk usage of files/directories.
I/O scheduler	Determines how read/write requests are ordered.
Deadline scheduler	Favors fast response time; good for servers.
CFQ scheduler	Complete Fair Queuing; balances across tasks.
NOOP scheduler	Minimal scheduler; best for SSDs.
iostat	Display I/O statistics and CPU usage.
ioping	Test I/O latency like ping.
Storage quota	Restrict how much space users/groups can use.
quotacheck	Create quota database.
edquota	Edit quota for user/group.
setquota	Set quota limits directly.
fstab quota settings	Add usrquota and grpquota options to enable quotas.
repquota	Show quota report.
warnquota	Send quota warnings to users/groups.
